#*What is this?*
First of all let me explain little bit about my self i am working as an Associate Engineer at the moment and yeah this is still my first job.So i got this task to implement the gateway for the plugin i mentioned above.So i asked for support and the answer was you need to write it on your own so with bunch of help from google and people who guided me on various ways i managed to get this done.
#About the code
i've created this gateway option for one of my client and the gateway is not a complete best code still.And i am not fully competent with WordPress either.i am looking forward to update it with features or security measures as much as i can.I studied the Paypal gateway The event Manager team have provided(Thanks a lot guys) and tried to develop the code.Its at the moment working fine(but i am looking forward to more implementations)
Hey i've already created the Git Hub repository for this so i'll just put the link here!

All ideas and suggestions are warmly welcome.If you see any stupid codes and unnecessary things(i think its there still as i copied Paypal sample gateway)Please correct it or let me know!

Thanks!
