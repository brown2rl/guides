
Today’s tutorial is about ***‘Dashboards’***. No matter what you do, you can’t escape from them. Every department inside every company is chasing some goal and there is no better way to monitor its status than to have a compact dashboard that monitors all the related metrics. 

Marketing is running after getting leads, Sales is running after closing leads and Developers are running after solving bugs. There is a dashboard for all such use cases. And if you are a developer then at some point you will have to make a dashboard for your company. So I am going to talk about creating one in this tutorial. 

We are going to use [JavaScript charts](http://www.fusioncharts.com/) library offered by FusionCharts for making charts. But instead of doing it in vanilla JavaScript, we are going to use React - the hottest JavaScript framework at the moment. And rightly so in my opinion.

In our dashboard we are going to explore performance of Acme, Inc. in 2015. We will see what were its top revenue generating countries, monthly revenue trend and highest performing product categories. This is what our final dashboard will look like:

You can [see the live version here](https://rohitb4.github.io/react-dashboard/) and find the [GitHub repo for the project here](https://github.com/rohitb4/react-dashboard).

FusionCharts makes our job little bit easier by providing a dedicated plugin for making [charts in React](http://www.fusioncharts.com/reactjs-charts/). Before we jump into the tutorial, let us explore a bit about React.

## About React, and Why React?
React is a JavaScript library for creating reusable View components for the web. The thing about React that makes it fast is if you want to update your View you re-render the whole View and React will figure out the optimal way to update the DOM (Document Object Model). To achieve this React uses Virtual DOM and DOM Diff algorithm. You can [read more about it on this StackOverflow thread.](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/21109361/why-is-reacts-concept-of-virtual-dom-said-to-be-more-performant-than-dirty-mode) 

**Note:** If you want to follow along for rest of the tutorial, then please download FusionCharts core library from [here](http://www.fusioncharts.com/download/), and its React plugin from [here](http://www.fusioncharts.com/reactjs-charts/).

## Setup
As mentioned above, to create our dashboard, we will be using React and FusionCharts. To abstract out the details of FusionCharts in a React friendly manner, we will be using the React Plugin provided by FusionCharts. So we need to include the JavaScript files of React, FusionCharts and React-FusionCharts plugin. To get started, embed the above three scripts in the HTML page using `<script>` tags.

To write applications in React, it is better if we use JSX syntax. Although it is not advised and applications can be created in vanilla javascript, using JSX will give a clear picture of the code and the code will be concise. For that reason we will be building this dashboard in JSX. You can [read more about JSX here](https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/jsx-in-depth.html).


```
// React Scripts
<script src='https://fb.me/react-with-addons-0.14.6.js'></script>
<script src='https://fb.me/JSXTransformer-0.13.3.js'></script>

// FusionCharts files
<script src='js/fusioncharts.js'></script>
<script src='js/fusioncharts.charts.js'></script>
<script src='js/fusioncharts.powercharts.js'></script>

// React FusionCharts plugin
<script src='js/react-fusioncharts.min.js'></script>

// theme file
<script src='js/fusioncharts.theme.carbon.js'></script> 
```


**Note:** Including the JSX Transformer is only suggested for development applications. For Production ready code, precompile the JSX and you need not include this file.

With the basic setup ready, we will add some markup and React JSX code to create the dashboard.

## Creating HTML Page for the Dashboard
In the dashboard we are building, we are creating three visualizations of various revenue metrics of Acme Inc. We will create a column chart to show revenues from top six revenue generating countries, a spline chart (smoother version of line chart) to show the revenue distribution over various months of the year, and a donut chart to figure out which product category generated the highest percentage share of the revenue. So, in short we will be rendering column, spline and donut charts.

We will create the column chart spanning the entire width of the page, and spline and donut charts in a two column layout to span 50% width. The following HTML and CSS would create HTML container to create this layout. The HTML containers are where the charts will be rendered.

HTML:
```
<div class="chart-row">
	<div id="country-revenue"></div>
</div>

<div class="chart-row">
	<div id="monthly-revenue" class="inline-chart">
	</div>
	<div id="product-revenue" class="inline-chart">
	</div>
</div>
```

CSS:
```
.chart-row {
  margin-bottom: 15px;
}
.inline-chart {
  display: inline-block;
  width: 48%;
  margin-left: 1%;
}
```

Now we will prepare the data for these three charts and render them in the containers we have have just created.

## Creating the React Component
With the HTML structure ready, we will create a root React component based on our HTML structure. We make the HTML structure into a valid JSX and return it in the render function of the component. To achieve that we make a few changes like changing `class` to `className`.

This is the react component that we create:
```
var DashboardApp = React.createClass({
  render: function() {
    return (
      <div>
        <h1 className="main-title">Acme Inc. Revenue Analysis for 2015</h1>
        <div id="interactive-dashbaord"></div>
        <div className="chart-row">
          <div id="country-revenue">
            // country revenue chart here
          </div>
        </div>
        <div className="chart-row">
          <div id="monthly-revenue" className="inline-chart">
            // chart 2 here - spline
          </div>
          <div id="product-revenue" className="inline-chart">
            // chart 3 here - donut
          </div>
        </div>
      </div>
    );
  }
});
```

Then we render this component into an HTML element:
```
React.render(
	<DashboardApp />,
	document.getElementById("dashboard")
);
```

This is an empty react component that we have created and rendered. We need to create the charts in it and render them in the skeleton markup we have designed. In the next sections we will go through how to do that.

## Creating Multiple Chart Components
I will now go through the process of creating one chart (column) in detail. Creating the other two charts is similar and I will point out the differences in the description below. 

### Preparing Data for the Chart
Every charting library has a slightly different input data format. Since we are using FusionCharts for our project, we need to format our data in a format that FusionCharts understands. It accepts JSON data as an array of objects containing label and value. This is what the syntax looks like:

```
[{
	"label": "Orange",
	"value": "90"
},{
	"label": "Yellow",
	"value": "60"
}...]
```

### Creating the Chart Configuration
Chart configuration contains various attributes of the chart like chart type, caption, sub-caption, theme to name a few. It also contains the data to be plotted. 

Data, chart type, height, width are the main attributes where our charts will differ. There are other theme related attributes as well which will be mostly same for all the 3 charts.

A sample chart configuration looks something like this:
```
{
  type: "doughnut2d",
  renderAt: "product-revenue",
  width: '100%',
  height: 400,
  dataFormat: "json",
  dataSource: {
    chart: {
      caption: "Top 5 stores in last month by revenue",
      theme: "carbon"
    },
    data: [{
        "label": "Jan",
        "value": "657000"
      }, {
        "label": "Feb",
        "value": "138000"
      },
      ... {
        "label": "Dec",
        "value": "730000"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

### Creating a Chart Using the React Plugin
With the chart configuration ready, we can create the React chart. We will use the React plugin API to create it. The only input to the plugin is the configuration that we created earlier. We can simply create it using the following code.
```
<react_fc.FusionCharts {...countryChartConfigs} />
```


### Creating Other Two Charts
The chart we created above is a column chart. The other two charts are spline and donut. We create chart configurations for these two and mention the right types and create the React chart component.
```
<react_fc.FusionCharts {...monthlyChartConfigs} />
<react_fc.FusionCharts {...productChartConfigs} />
```

Now we need to place the three chart components appropriately in the JSX of the `DashboardApp` we create earlier. This is the new JSX after placing the chart components.

```
<div>
  <h1 className="main-title">Acme Inc. Revenue Analysis for 2015</h1>
  <div id="interactive-dashbaord"></div>
  <div className="chart-row">
    <div id="country-revenue">
      <react_fc.FusionCharts {...countryChartConfigs} />
    </div>
  </div>
  <div className="chart-row">
    <div id="monthly-revenue" className="inline-chart">
      <react_fc.FusionCharts {...monthlyChartConfigs} />
    </div>
    <div id="product-revenue" className="inline-chart">
      <react_fc.FusionCharts {...productChartConfigs} />
    </div>
  </div>
</div>
```

After adding this you should see the dashboard rendered on your page. If you had any issues or want to see the source code of the project, [head over to project’s GitHub repo](https://github.com/rohitb4/react-dashboard).

## More Resources
Using the process I described above, you will be able to create relatively sophisticated charts and dashboards in React. But we all come across issues when we try to build things on our own. To help you in the hour of your need I have listed some resources below:

- **Official plugin page and GitHub repo:** Here are handy links for [React charts](http://www.fusioncharts.com/reactjs-charts/) official plugin page and its [GitHub repo](https://github.com/fusioncharts/react-fusioncharts). These are the first places you should head towards if you have any issues with the plugin as they contain all the relevant information.
- **Documentation:** You can [find the official documentation for the plugin here](http://www.fusioncharts.com/dev/using-with-javascript-libraries/reactjs/introduction.html). It covers everything from getting started to some advanced topics like adding annotations to the chart.
- **Make the dashboard more interactive:** I made a relatively simple dashboard in this tutorial as the objective was to get you started with making charts in React. But there is a lot of interactivity you can add to the charts using [events](http://www.fusioncharts.com/dev/api/fusioncharts/fusioncharts-events.html) and [methods](http://www.fusioncharts.com/dev/api/fusioncharts/fusioncharts-methods.html) provided by FusionCharts. Check out this [advanced dashboard](http://fusioncharts.github.io/react-fusioncharts/#/dashboard) depicting Global Terrorism stats built using React and FusionCharts for some inspiration.
