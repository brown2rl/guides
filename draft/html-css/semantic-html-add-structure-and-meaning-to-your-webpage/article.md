## Why Semantic
Semantic HTML's primary purpose is to provide both structure and meaning. 
Why write semantic HTML? There are a lot of benefits including, more readable and efficient code. It makes it easier for web crawlers and assistive devices/software to understand the structure of your web page, which makes it more accessible. 


## Structure

The structure of a web page is called the Document Outline.
Arguably some elements are more structurally important to semantics than other elements. The most important are the ```
header
```, ```
hgroup
```, ```
nav
```, ```
article
```, ```
figure
```, ```
figcaption
```, ```
time
```, ```
section
```, ```
aside
```, and 
```
footer
```
 elements.




### header

#### hgroup

### footer

### nav

### article and section
A ```
section
``` tag can be named by placing a ```
header
``` tag directly inside of it.

### aside

### time

### figure

#### figcaption

## Meaning

A ```
div
``` tag does not have any semantic meaning, and does not add any structure to your page.


Many sections can have both a ```
header
``` and a ```
footer
```, but you can't put them inside of each other.
