This placeholder guide will eventually be a Ruby on Rails verses Node.js guide.  Here are some assorted notes which will be assembled into a guide:

<h1> Pros of Node: </h1>

- Can program in one language for both client-side pages and server

- Can work with existing JavaScript programmers and get them up to speed on Node.js fast

- People who know Node.js are generally very good programmers, since they enjoy being on the cutting edge.  So this causes a positive adverse selection problem when hiring.

- Code is going to be generally faster because everything must not be a blocking call (although savvy developers can simulate this in Ruby via EventMachine)

<h1> Cons of Node: </h1>

- Lots of Rails-like frameworks available. The core team hasn't settled on one / the community hasn't fully rallied behind one yet

- Event driven non blocking callback architecture causes debugging confusion

- Early on standardized tools/IDEs

- StackExchange answers to questions are going to be more sparse compared to Ruby

- JavaScript code can look a bit unwieldy since the language isn't as modern

- JavaScript has an explosion of libraries and doesn't have a good core agreed-upon library

- Ruby has more docs / tutorials available online

- Harder to hire developers who know how to develop Node.js (not just JavaScript)
