## Intro
In this tutorial, you’ll learn how the app [ShoppingTODO](http://shopping-todo.com/) (published both in [Apple's App Store](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/shopping-todo/id1084227361?ls=1&mt=8) and [Google's Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.shopping_todo)) was built. You'll get access to the full source code on [Github](https://github.com/Hitman666/IonicShoppingTodoFirebaseMaterial) and we'll go through each and every file and explain all the bits and pieces that were needed for it to work. 

You’ll learn how to use [Firebase](https://www.firebase.com/) as your backend and also how to incorporate the Material design. The app will have features like **list sharing**, **budget tracking** and **live updates**.

You can even try the app in your browser [here](http://shopping-todo.com/mobile/index.html#/app/login). With Ionic, it's easy to take the same code base and deploy to an actual mobile App store and a standalone website application.

For actual deployment to the App Stores, please take a look at [the fourth tutorial](http://tutorials.pluralsight.com/review/how-to-publish-our-calculator-application-to-the-apple-s-app-store-and-google-s-play-store/article.md) which covers the exacts steps you need to take in order to publish a finished application to Apple's App Store and Google's Play Store.

# It all starts with an idea
As you already learned through this series, it all starts with an idea. The idea serves to solve a problem that we may have. Our problem is easy to define; we tend to forget things that we have to buy at the store. Even more so, we don't like getting tricked into buying stuff we don't need and then having buyers remorse the second we get home. How many times have you gone to the store with a list full of items to buy? And how many times were you crossing it off with your pen while, in the other hand, using your smartphone to chat with your friend? So, wouldn’t it make more sense to just accomplish both of those tasks directly from your phone and ditch the pen and paper?

The app will let you enter items. You would likely prepare this list at home, and then once in the store you’d be able to enter exact prices and amounts of the stuff you actually bought. The most useful thing when hacking the budget will be its immediate display of the total price. Also, live updates will enable just-in-time edits so that the person you share lists with doesn't have to call you to let you know that you should add that "one more thing.”

## Design
The way we’ll approach this implementation is that we'll try to reuse as much as open source help as possible. So, we'll use an open source theme. Since Material design is the new cool thing, we'll use the following [open source template](https://github.com/zachsoft/Ionic-Material). More specifically, we will only use the demo example.

## Finished project screens
The finished app, which you can take a look at [here](http://shopping-todo.com/), has the following screens:

+ Login: The app offers Facebook and Google login, and it even has the DEMO mode where you can test the app without needing to log in

<img src="http://i.imgur.com/6DqqUlY.jpg" style="width: 300px" />

+ Home screen: You can add as many projects (we call them `groups` in the code) as you like.

<img src="http://i.imgur.com/cnD3Wbv.jpg" style="width: 300px" />

+ Project screen: Shows a list of items that need to be bought and those that are already bought, with a view of the price of bought/to-buy items.

+ Adding users to your project

<img src="http://i.imgur.com/k9olacL.jpg" style="width: 300px" />

## Finished project code
You can clone the project and get it running locally by doing the following:

+ clone the code from [Github](https://github.com/Hitman666/IonicShoppingTodoFirebaseMaterial)
+ `cd` into the new folder
+ run `ionic serve`
+ you should see the login screen (shown above) in your browser

If you want to run it on your phone, you need to make sure the plugins listed below are installed (after adding the platform with `ionic platform add ios` or `ionic platform add android`). You can list the installed plugins by executing `ionic plugin list` in your project root directory (where your **ionic.project** file resides).

+ cordova-plugin-admobpro 2.11.1 "AdMob Plugin Pro"
+ cordova-plugin-extension 1.2.9 "Cordova Plugin Extension"
+ cordova-plugin-inappbrowser 1.2.1 "InAppBrowser"
+ cordova-plugin-splashscreen 3.2.0 "Splashscreen"
+ cordova-plugin-statusbar 2.1.1 "StatusBar"
+ cordova-plugin-whitelist 1.2.1 "Whitelist"
+ ionic-plugin-keyboard 1.0.8 "Keyboard"

To install the missing plugins, here's a copy/paste installation shortcut (execute this in your Command prompt/Terminal once in the root of your project):

+ cordova plugin add cordova-plugin-admobpro
+ cordova plugin add cordova-plugin-extension
+ cordova plugin add cordova-plugin-inappbrowser
+ cordova plugin add cordova-plugin-splashscreen
+ cordova plugin add cordova-plugin-statusbar
+ cordova plugin add cordova-plugin-whitelist
+ cordova plugin add ionic-plugin-keyboard

You can also  take a look at this project with your [Ionic View](http://view.ionic.io/) application (we mentioned this in the previous tutorials) by entering the code: **4f055b6d**. Or, as mentioned before, you can download it from the [App Store](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/shopping-todo/id1084227361?ls=1&mt=8) or [Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.shopping_todo) or even try it out [in your browser](http://shopping-todo.com/mobile/index.html).


## How does it work?
As I mentioned in the design section above, I used an awesome [Ionic Material](https://github.com/zachsoft/Ionic-Material) template as a basis for this project. I cloned the project with:

`git clone https://github.com/zachsoft/Ionic-Material`

I took out the `demo` folder for the basis of my project. You can do the same steps, and once you're in the demo folder, if you run `ionic serve --lab’, you'll get the following screen:

![](http://i.imgur.com/5ArTdPb.jpg)

### Starting point

> From this point on, I will not copy/paste the full source code that I'm referring to here, nor will I explain every single line, since that would become too cumbersome (besides, you're already pretty familiar with Ionic framework by now if you've been following the series). Instead, I’ll give you the link on Github to the exact file/function that I'm referring to and will only show those lines of code necessary to explain what's happening. Of course, if you have any questions, please post them as comments on this post and I'll be happy to help.

From my experience, when trying to understand some Ionic framework code, I always go to `app.js` file first and check out the [config() function](https://github.com/Hitman666/IonicShoppingTodoFirebaseMaterial/blob/master/www/js/app.js#L112)(_click to view on Github_) to see how the routes are set up. Looking at our example we can see that the first screen that shows up is at route `/app/login`:

`$urlRouterProvider.otherwise('/app/login');`

We can now check the definition of this state and see that it looks like this:

```
.state('app.login', {
    url: '/login',
    views: {
        'menuContent': {
            templateUrl: 'templates/login.html',
            controller: 'LoginCtrl'
        },
        'fabContent': {
            template: ''
        }
    }
})
```

From here we can conclude several things:

+ the login state is `app.login` and we can reference it by that string
+ the login url is `/login` and that's what you would see in your URL if you ran it in  your browser
+ the login has two views (`menuContent` nad `fabContent`)
+ HTML of the `menuContent` view is defined in the `templates/login.html` file
+ `fabContent` view doesn’t have a template associated with it

Concerning the two views, it's how the author of this template envisioned this. And, in case you're wondering about the name "fab," it comes from the  Floating Action Button in [Material design documentation](https://www.google.com/design/spec/components/buttons-floating-action-button.html). Consequently, this is the view that will hold the FAB button (+ button in the bottom right corner on the app screen images above).

### login.html
So, let's now check out the login logic by first examining the [login.html](https://github.com/Hitman666/IonicShoppingTodoFirebaseMaterial/blob/master/www/templates/login.html)(_click to view on Github_) template. The only interesting part here is the `ng-click` on the login buttons which calls the `oauthLogin()` function (with a proper provider passed in - 'facebook' or 'google') and the call to `testAppWithoutLogin()` function, which basically logs a user in with an existing demo account.

###Firebase
In this project, Firebase is used as app's backend, including data storage and user authentication. It features a real-time database, and it can also do static hosting. You can learn more about it (there are guides for a lot of platforms) [here](https://www.firebase.com/docs/).

### LoginCtrl
`LoginCtrl`, found in [js/controllers.js](https://github.com/Hitman666/IonicShoppingTodoFirebaseMaterial/blob/master/www/js/controllers.js#L92)(_click to view on Github_) file, is the controller that contains the logic for the `login.html` template.

This controller contains three functions:

+ [oauthLogin](https://github.com/Hitman666/IonicShoppingTodoFirebaseMaterial/blob/master/www/js/controllers.js#L130) - depending on the passed parameter it calls the corresponding function in the [Auth service](https://github.com/Hitman666/IonicShoppingTodoFirebaseMaterial/blob/master/www/js/Auth.js)
+ [testAppWithoutLogin](https://github.com/Hitman666/IonicShoppingTodoFirebaseMaterial/blob/master/www/js/controllers.js#L166) - prepares the demo user object and calls the [validateUser](https://github.com/Hitman666/IonicShoppingTodoFirebaseMaterial/blob/master/www/js/controllers.js#L104) function that calls the `loginWithEmail` function in the aforementioned Auth service.

[Auth service](https://github.com/Hitman666/IonicShoppingTodoFirebaseMaterial/blob/master/www/js/Auth.js) is basically a custom factory that via AngularFire's (Angular wrapper for Firebase) `$firebaseAuth` service calls functions like `$authWithOAuthPopup` and `$authWithPassword`.

One important thing to note in the Auth service is the [onAuth](https://github.com/Hitman666/IonicShoppingTodoFirebaseMaterial/blob/master/www/js/Auth.js#L55) function which wraps the `$onAuth` function with `$timeout` so it processes in the digest loop. In case you're wondering, we're listening to this event in the [app.js](https://github.com/Hitman666/IonicShoppingTodoFirebaseMaterial/blob/master/www/js/app.js#L83) file.

> You can [learn more about AngularFire](https://www.firebase.com/docs/web/libraries/angular/quickstart.html) from official Firebase documentation. More specifically, they have a [step by step tutorial for Ionic](https://www.firebase.com/docs/web/libraries/ionic/guide.html) as well, which you can follow in order to get a better grasp on the subject.
 
As for the social logins (Facebook and Google), you’ll have to create applications on their developer sites and you can follow the corresponding step-by-step official tutorials [here](https://www.firebase.com/docs/web/guide/login/facebook.html) and [here](https://www.firebase.com/docs/web/guide/login/google.html) to learn how to do that. Basic Firebase user authentication documentation can be found [here](https://www.firebase.com/docs/web/guide/user-auth.html).

As a quick tip on linking Facebook and Firebase; all you have to do is enable Facebook authentication in the settings and enter the appropriate App Id and Secret (which you'll get once you create a Facebook application).

![](http://i.imgur.com/gKBjZdK.jpg)

Additionally, probably the only part that you must not forget about is to set the proper OAuth redirect URI on the Facebook `Settings -> Advanced` tab:

![](http://i.imgur.com/Yu2liaH.jpg)

### User profile
Once the user logs in successfully we forward him to the `app.profile` state, as you can see [in the code](https://github.com/Hitman666/IonicShoppingTodoFirebaseMaterial/blob/master/www/js/app.js#L63). Now, again we go back to the [app.js config part](https://github.com/Hitman666/IonicShoppingTodoFirebaseMaterial/blob/master/www/js/app.js#L156) to see the route definition for this state:

```
.state('app.profile', {
    url: '/profile',
    views: {
        'menuContent': {
            templateUrl: 'templates/profile.html',
            controller: 'ProfileCtrl'
        },
        'fabContent': {
            templateUrl: 'templates/profileFabButtonAdd.html',
            controller: 'ProfileCtrlFabButton'
        }
    }
})
```

From here we can conclude several things:

+ the profile state is `app.profile` and we can reference it by that string
+ the profile url is `/profile` and that's what you would see in your URL if you ran it in  your browser
+ the profile has two views `menuContent` and `fabContent`
+ HTML of the `menuContent` view is defined in the `templates/profile.html` file. Also, this template has a corresponding `ProfileCtrl` controller
+ HTML of the `fabContent` view is defined in the `templates/profileFabButtonAdd.html` file. Also, this template has a corresponding `ProfileCtrlFabButton` controller

### profile.html
The [profile.html](https://github.com/Hitman666/IonicShoppingTodoFirebaseMaterial/blob/master/www/templates/profile.html)(_click to view on Github_) template displays a (logged in) user’s profile image, name, and email. Also, it lists his existing projects (if he has any) with the [ng-repeat directive](https://github.com/Hitman666/IonicShoppingTodoFirebaseMaterial/blob/master/www/templates/profile.html#L34)(_click to view on Github_).

Inside the ng-repeat directive, we’re displaying the project image and name. By using the `<ion-option-button>` directive, we're adding support for the "swipe left" gesture which reveals `Remove` and `Edit` buttons, which in turn call the corresponding [Remove](https://github.com/Hitman666/IonicShoppingTodoFirebaseMaterial/blob/master/www/js/controllers.js#L451) and [Edit](https://github.com/Hitman666/IonicShoppingTodoFirebaseMaterial/blob/master/www/js/controllers.js#L502) functions in the [ProfileCtrl](https://github.com/Hitman666/IonicShoppingTodoFirebaseMaterial/blob/master/www/js/controllers.js#L402) via the `ng-click` directive.

### profileFabButtonAdd.html
[This file](https://github.com/Hitman666/IonicShoppingTodoFirebaseMaterial/blob/master/www/templates/profileFabButtonAdd.html) contains a simple button that’s used for adding the new project. The `ng-click` directive calls the [add](https://github.com/Hitman666/IonicShoppingTodoFirebaseMaterial/blob/master/www/js/controllers.js#L578) function, defined in [ProfileCtrlFabButton controller](https://github.com/Hitman666/IonicShoppingTodoFirebaseMaterial/blob/master/www/js/controllers.js#L568).

The `add` function basically shows the popup (via `$ionicPopup` service) and, after the user enters the new project name and confirms, it calls the `GroupAdd` function defined on the [Groups factory](https://github.com/Hitman666/IonicShoppingTodoFirebaseMaterial/blob/master/www/js/data.js#L55) (in the file named [data.js](https://github.com/Hitman666/IonicShoppingTodoFirebaseMaterial/blob/master/www/js/data.js)).

### Adding items to the list
Once the user creates a new project (list) and clicks on this list in their profile they’ll be forwarded to the `app.list({id: g.id, ime: g.name})` state, as you can see [in the code](https://github.com/Hitman666/IonicShoppingTodoFirebaseMaterial/blob/master/www/templates/profile.html#L34). Now, again, we go back to the [app.js config part](https://github.com/Hitman666/IonicShoppingTodoFirebaseMaterial/blob/master/www/js/app.js#L129) to see the route definition for this state:

```
.state('app.list', {
    url: '/list/:id/:ime',
    views: {
        'menuContent': {
            templateUrl: 'templates/list.html',
            controller: 'ListCtrl'
        },
        'fabContent': {
            templateUrl: 'templates/listFabButtonAdd.html',
            controller: 'ListCtrlFabButton'
        }
    }
})
```

From here we can conclude several things:

+ the list state is `app.list` and we can reference it by that string
+ the list url is `/list` with additional two url parameters `id` and `ime` (in case you're wondering that's Croatian for 'name' - _yeah, inconsistency isn't a virtue_)
+ the list has two views: `menuContent` and `fabContent`
+ HTML of the `menuContent` view is defined in the `templates/list.html` file. Also, this template has a corresponding `listCtrl` controller
+ HTML of the `fabContent` view is defined in the `templates/listFabButtonAdd.html` file. Also, this template has a corresponding `ListCtrlFabButton` controller

### list.html
The [list.html](https://github.com/Hitman666/IonicShoppingTodoFirebaseMaterial/blob/master/www/templates/list.html)(_click to view on Github_) template displays the items (along with their name, price, and quantity) added to the list.

Inside the ng-repeat directive, we’re displaying the item name, price and quantity, ordered by `isCompleted` property, which indicates that the item has been "bought."

Each list item can be [deleted](https://github.com/Hitman666/IonicShoppingTodoFirebaseMaterial/blob/master/www/templates/list.html#L33) and marked as ["bought"](https://github.com/Hitman666/IonicShoppingTodoFirebaseMaterial/blob/master/www/templates/list.html#L43) by clicking the corresponding button, which in turn then calls the corresponding [Remove](https://github.com/Hitman666/IonicShoppingTodoFirebaseMaterial/blob/master/www/js/controllers.js#L230) and [CheckOrUncheck](https://github.com/Hitman666/IonicShoppingTodoFirebaseMaterial/blob/master/www/js/controllers.js#L238) functions in the [ListCtrl](https://github.com/Hitman666/IonicShoppingTodoFirebaseMaterial/blob/master/www/js/controllers.js#L176) via the `ng-click` directive.

These two controller functions call the functions defined in the `Groups` factory, which then deals with Firebase in order to delete the item or mark it as completed. Important to note is the usage of [transaction](https://github.com/Hitman666/IonicShoppingTodoFirebaseMaterial/blob/master/www/js/controllers.js#L240) operation on the returned item, which basically secures that some change happens in a transaction (from database theory this means either the data will be saved or it will not be saved at all).

`transaction()` returns stored data so you can [manipulate](https://github.com/Hitman666/IonicShoppingTodoFirebaseMaterial/blob/master/www/js/controllers.js#L243) it and change the data that is [returned](https://github.com/Hitman666/IonicShoppingTodoFirebaseMaterial/blob/master/www/js/controllers.js#L245). You can learn more about transaction function from the [official documentation](https://www.firebase.com/docs/web/api/firebase/transaction.html).

### Inviting users to your list
Additionally, this template has [one more button](https://github.com/Hitman666/IonicShoppingTodoFirebaseMaterial/blob/master/www/templates/list.html#L4) which is used for adding a new user to the list of users who share this concrete list. The `ng-click` directive calls the [addUserToGroup](https://github.com/Hitman666/IonicShoppingTodoFirebaseMaterial/blob/master/www/js/controllers.js#L285) function, defined in [ListCtrl controller](https://github.com/Hitman666/IonicShoppingTodoFirebaseMaterial/blob/master/www/js/controllers.js#176).

This function shows a popup with a username input field. Once the user enters his friend's email and confirms it, the controller will call the external service on the server, which will actually send an email to this person notifying them that their friend added them to the list. 

Also, this list will appear in their project list once they log in to their account. You can, of course, comment [this code](https://github.com/Hitman666/IonicShoppingTodoFirebaseMaterial/blob/master/www/js/controllers.js#L338) out or place your own API for this.

### listFabButtonAdd.html
[This file](https://github.com/Hitman666/IonicShoppingTodoFirebaseMaterial/blob/master/www/templates/listFabButtonAdd.html) contains a simple button that’s used for adding the new item to the list. The `ng-click` directive calls the [add](https://github.com/Hitman666/IonicShoppingTodoFirebaseMaterial/blob/master/www/js/controllers.js#L357) function, defined in [ListCtrlFabButton controller](https://github.com/Hitman666/IonicShoppingTodoFirebaseMaterial/blob/master/www/js/controllers.js#L351).

The `add` function shows the popup (via `$ionicPopup` service) and, after the user enters the new item name, price and quantity, and confirms, it calls the `GroupItemAdd` function defined on the [Groups factory](https://github.com/Hitman666/IonicShoppingTodoFirebaseMaterial/blob/master/www/js/data.js#L219) (in [data.js file](https://github.com/Hitman666/IonicShoppingTodoFirebaseMaterial/blob/master/www/js/data.js) file).

### Groups factory
Let us take a moment now and go over the functions in the [Groups factory](https://github.com/Hitman666/IonicShoppingTodoFirebaseMaterial/blob/master/www/js/data.js#L55):

+ [Groups.byUser](https://github.com/Hitman666/IonicShoppingTodoFirebaseMaterial/blob/master/www/js/data.js#L63) - This whole function is done in chained promises. We first get all groups that are stored in array in the [user object](https://github.com/Hitman666/IonicShoppingTodoFirebaseMaterial/blob/master/www/js/data.js#L64). Then we [iterate](https://github.com/Hitman666/IonicShoppingTodoFirebaseMaterial/blob/master/www/js/data.js#L68) through this list and [create an array](https://github.com/Hitman666/IonicShoppingTodoFirebaseMaterial/blob/master/www/js/data.js#L70) with promises for all [groups in the list](https://github.com/Hitman666/IonicShoppingTodoFirebaseMaterial/blob/master/www/js/data.js#L71). Next, we  get [items](https://github.com/Hitman666/IonicShoppingTodoFirebaseMaterial/blob/master/www/js/data.js#L75) for that group (this was added initially because we thought of adding item list under the group name). After that we [iterate through members array](https://github.com/Hitman666/IonicShoppingTodoFirebaseMaterial/blob/master/www/js/data.js#L93) in group and [create an array of promises](https://github.com/Hitman666/IonicShoppingTodoFirebaseMaterial/blob/master/www/js/data.js#L95) which we [resolve](https://github.com/Hitman666/IonicShoppingTodoFirebaseMaterial/blob/master/www/js/data.js#L104) in the end with [Promise.all](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise/all). After members are resolved we return an [array of group promises](https://github.com/Hitman666/IonicShoppingTodoFirebaseMaterial/blob/master/www/js/data.js#L115) and [resolve this whole array in the end](https://github.com/Hitman666/IonicShoppingTodoFirebaseMaterial/blob/master/www/js/data.js#L118).

+ [Groups.Group](https://github.com/Hitman666/IonicShoppingTodoFirebaseMaterial/blob/master/www/js/data.js#L122) - Returns a promise for group data.

+ [Groups.GroupAdd](https://github.com/Hitman666/IonicShoppingTodoFirebaseMaterial/blob/master/www/js/data.js#L126) - First we need to [create a reference](https://github.com/Hitman666/IonicShoppingTodoFirebaseMaterial/blob/master/www/js/data.js#L129) with [push()](https://www.firebase.com/docs/web/api/firebase/push.html) which contains a new unique key for that group. Then we fill the [object of that group](https://github.com/Hitman666/IonicShoppingTodoFirebaseMaterial/blob/master/www/js/data.js#L133), and, with reference that we got from `push()`, we [write this object](https://github.com/Hitman666/IonicShoppingTodoFirebaseMaterial/blob/master/www/js/data.js#L145) with [set()](https://www.firebase.com/docs/web/api/firebase/set.html) function.

+ [Groups.GroupAddMember](https://github.com/Hitman666/IonicShoppingTodoFirebaseMaterial/blob/master/www/js/data.js#L155) - First we [add a group key to user object](https://github.com/Hitman666/IonicShoppingTodoFirebaseMaterial/blob/master/www/js/data.js#L161) and then we [add the user to the group](https://github.com/Hitman666/IonicShoppingTodoFirebaseMaterial/blob/master/www/js/data.js#L168) object under members.

+ [Groups.GroupRemoveMember](https://github.com/Hitman666/IonicShoppingTodoFirebaseMaterial/blob/master/www/js/data.js#L179) - Here we use [remove()](https://www.firebase.com/docs/web/api/firebase/remove.html) function to remove a member from group object and return a promise which this function returns.

+ [Groups.GroupRemove](https://github.com/Hitman666/IonicShoppingTodoFirebaseMaterial/blob/master/www/js/data.js#L188) - Before we can remove the group we need to [clean the items](https://github.com/Hitman666/IonicShoppingTodoFirebaseMaterial/blob/master/www/js/data.js#L192) associated with this group. In order to do so, we can get the reference for these items through [GroupItems](https://github.com/Hitman666/IonicShoppingTodoFirebaseMaterial/blob/master/www/js/data.js#L211) function. After we successfully delete this group, we [remove the group](https://github.com/Hitman666/IonicShoppingTodoFirebaseMaterial/blob/master/www/js/data.js#L196) from groups list and [remove group key from user object](https://github.com/Hitman666/IonicShoppingTodoFirebaseMaterial/blob/master/www/js/data.js#L200).

+ [Groups.GroupItems](https://github.com/Hitman666/IonicShoppingTodoFirebaseMaterial/blob/master/www/js/data.js#L211) - Returns reference to the list of group items.

+ [Groups.GroupItem](https://github.com/Hitman666/IonicShoppingTodoFirebaseMaterial/blob/master/www/js/data.js#L215)  - Returns the reference to one record (by item key) from list of items for some group.

+ [Groups.GroupItemAdd](https://github.com/Hitman666/IonicShoppingTodoFirebaseMaterial/blob/master/www/js/data.js#L219) - Just like when we were adding a new group, we need to first call [push()](https://github.com/Hitman666/IonicShoppingTodoFirebaseMaterial/blob/master/www/js/data.js#L222) on reference that we got from `Groups.GroupItems` in order to get the reference to the new group, and a unique key for that group. Then we fill the [object of that item](https://github.com/Hitman666/IonicShoppingTodoFirebaseMaterial/blob/master/www/js/data.js#L226), and with the reference that we got from `push()` [write this object](https://github.com/Hitman666/IonicShoppingTodoFirebaseMaterial/blob/master/www/js/data.js#L238) with [set()](https://www.firebase.com/docs/web/api/firebase/set.html) function.

+ [Groups.GroupItemRemove](https://github.com/Hitman666/IonicShoppingTodoFirebaseMaterial/blob/master/www/js/data.js#L252)  - To [remove item from group item list](https://github.com/Hitman666/IonicShoppingTodoFirebaseMaterial/blob/master/www/js/data.js#L252) we call `remove()` function on the reference that we got from `Groups.GroupItems`

+ [Groups.setCurrentGroupId](https://github.com/Hitman666/IonicShoppingTodoFirebaseMaterial/blob/master/www/js/data.js#L264) and [Groups.getCurrentGroupId](https://github.com/Hitman666/IonicShoppingTodoFirebaseMaterial/blob/master/www/js/data.js#L268) - These functions are used to set and get [currentGroupId](https://github.com/Hitman666/IonicShoppingTodoFirebaseMaterial/blob/master/www/js/data.js#L59) that is used in [ListCtrl](https://github.com/Hitman666/IonicShoppingTodoFirebaseMaterial/blob/master/www/js/controllers.js#L176)

### Firebase access rules
What's left to show is how the Firebase rules (found in the `Dashboard -> Security & Rules` in your Firebase admin dashboard) are set up. You’ll find comments on how and what each rule does in the comments (parts marked with `//`).

```
{
  "rules": {
    // By default, make all data private unless specified otherwise.
    ".read": false,
    ".write": false,

        // Only authenticated user can read and make chanages on it's own data (auth.id equal to $userId)

        ".write": "(auth != null) && (auth.uid === $userId)",
        ".validate": "($userId === newData.child('id').val()) && (newData.hasChildren(['id','provider']))",

## Free to be free
I hope this tutorial, and the accompanying project, helped you see the potential that Firebase offers and that you'll create something great with it yourself. As I mentioned earlier, I encourage you to share your wishes and ideas about what kind of an app you’d like to see built and then explained. Remember, I'm here to help you get the best of Ionic framework, so don't hesitate to ask.

You're free to use this project in any way you like. You can fork it, make it better, submit your version to app store, make money out of it (just make sure you send me a beer or two if you pull it off!).

## How to get help with Ionic framework
Few of the resources that proved indispensable when I was learning about Ionic:

+ For a quick framework reference, I'm suggesting the [official documentation](http://ionicframework.com/docs/), which is indeed very good.
+ If you're in search for a good book about Ionic, you don't need to look further than [Ionic in Action: Hybrid Mobile Apps with Ionic and AngularJS](http://amzn.to/1EjwYNJ)
+ Of course, if you haven't, check out my posts in this series
+ One of the best resources on the net for programming related questions, about which you've no doubt heard, is [StackOverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/). You can view the specific Ionic tagged questions via [this link](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/ionic).
+ To get started with AngluarJS try [these](http://angular.codeschool.com/) [few](https://hackhands.com/finishing-Angular-TODO-application-deploying-production/) [resources](https://docs.angularjs.org/tutorial), not necessarily in that particular order.
+ Let me repeat myself by saying that if you have **any questions** about Ionic framework, or you had trouble following this tutorial (you couldn't install something), or you would like to suggest what kind of tutorials you would like to see regarding Ionic in the future, please **share it in the comments** below. Also, you can reach me personally via @[HitmanHR](https://twitter.com/hitmanhr) or [my blog](http://www.nikola-breznjak.com/blog). I'll do my best to  answer all of your questions.
+ If, however, you favor one-on-one help, you can reach me [via HackHands](https://hackhands.com/dashboard/request/hitman666/preferred).

## Credits
Matija Lesar helped me with this application and was responsible for communication with Firebase via Angular services and Firebase data model. He is eager to learn new things and try new programming languages but his real passion are databases and backend services. You can look him up on his [personal web page](http://ffox.com.hr).
